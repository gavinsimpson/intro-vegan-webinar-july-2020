## Description

For community ecologists using R, one of the most-used, and most-useful, add-on packages is vegan, which provides a wide range of functionality covering inter alia ordination, diversity analysis, and ecological simulation. This webinar will offer participants a practical introduction to some of the most useful functions available within vegan. In particular, the webinar will cover the unconstrained ordination methods

* Principal Components Analysis,
* Correspondence Analysis, and
* Non-metric Multi-Dimensional Scaling

as well as some of the associated functions for computing diversity measures, transforming data, and creating dissimilarity matrices.

By registering for the webinar you'll get emails linking you to webinar and the webinar materials (slides etc). The webinar is free to attend and all materials will be freely accessible. Registering just allows me to gauge interest and to provide updates to you in the lead up to the webinar.

The webinar will be live streamed on YouTube owing to the number of people that have registered. The recording will be available after the webinar if the time in your time zone isn't convenient for you.
