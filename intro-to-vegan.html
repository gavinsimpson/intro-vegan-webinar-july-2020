Three popular ones are

1. Shannon-Weaver

2. Simpson

3. Inverse Simpson

`\(p_i\)` is proportion of species `\(i\)`

`\(b\)` is the base, usually `\(e\)`

`\(S\)` is number of species (richness)

`$$H = - \sum_{i=1}^{S} p_i \log_b p_i$$`

`$$D_1 = 1 - \sum_{i=1}^{S} p_i^2$$`

`$$D_2 = \frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^{S} p_i^2}$$`

# Rarefaction

Species richness increases with sample size (effort)

Rarefaction gives the expected number of species rarefied from `\(N\)` to `\(n\)` individuals

`$$\hat{S}_n = \sum_{i=1}^S (1 - q_i) \; \mathsf{where} \; q_i = \frac{\binom{N - x_i}{n}}{\binom{N}{n}}$$`

`\(x_i\)` is count of species `\(i\)` and `\(\binom{N}{n}\)` is a binomial coefficient &amp;mdash; the number of ways to choose `\(n\)` from `\(N\)`

# Ordination

---
class: inverse middle center big-subsection

# ordnung

???

The word "ordination" comes from the German word "ordnung"

---

# Ordination

Putting things in order is exactly what we we do in ordination

* we arrange our samples along gradients by fitting lines and planes through the data that describe the main patterns in those data

* we map data to lower dimensions reflecting how similar the samples are to one another in terms of the variables measured

Three families of models

1. Linear
2. Unimodal
3. Distance-based

---
class: inverse middle center big-subsection

# Unconstrained

---

# Unconstrained

What is .text-higlight[unconstrained]?

First we look for major variation, then relate it to environmental variation

vs. *constrained* ordination, where we only want to see what can be explained by environmental variables of interest

*How well do we explain the main patterns in the species data*? vs *How large are the patterns we can expain with the measured data*?

---

# Ordination methods

Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is a linear method &amp;mdash; most useful for environmental data or sometimes with species data and short gradients

Correspondence Analysis (CA) is a unimodal method &amp;mdash; most useful for species data, especially where non-linear responses are observed

Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCO) and Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) &amp;mdash; can be used for any kind of data

---
class: inverse middle center huge-subsection

# PCA

---

# Principal Components Analysis

Instead of doing many regressions, do one with all the responses

No explanatory variables &amp;mdash; uncover latent, underlying gradients

PCA fits a line through our cloud of data in such a way that it maximises the variance in the data captured by that line (i.e.~minimises the distance between the fitted line and the observations)

Fit a second line to form a plane, and so on, until we have one PCA axis for every dimension of the data

Each of these subsequent axes is uncorrelated with previous axes &amp;mdash; they are .text-highlight[orthogonal] &amp;mdash; the variance each axis explains is uncorrelated

# Correspondence Analysis

# Correspondence Analysis

Correspondence analysis (CA) is very similar to PCA &amp;mdash; a weighted form of PCA

The row and column sums are used as weights and this has the effect of turning the analysis into one of relative composition

The weighting is a trick to get linear-based software to fit non-linear responses

These nonlinear response are assumed to unimodal Gaussian curves, all with equal height and tolerance widths, and equally spaced optima

So, not very realistic, but it is surprisingly robust at times to violation of this assumption

# Vegan basics

- The majority of vegan functions work with a single vector, or more commonly an entire data frame
- This data frame may contain the species abundances
- Where subsidiary data is used/required, these two are supplied as data frames
- For example; the environmental constraints in a CCA
- It is not a problem if you have all your data in a single file/object; just subset it into two data frames after reading it into R


```r
spp &lt;- allMyData[, 1:20] ## columns 1-20 contain the species data
env &lt;- allMyData[, 21:26] ## columns 21-26 contain the environmental data
```

# Simple vegan usage

First we start with a simple correspondence analysis (CA) to illustrate the basic features

Here I am using one of the in-built data sets on lichen pastures

For various reasons to fit a CA we use the `cca()` function

Store the fitted CA in `ca1` and print it to view the results

# `scores()` &amp; `scaling`

- When we draw the results of many ordinations we display 2 or more sets of data
- Can't display all of these and maintain relationships between the scores

# Scaling

How we scale scores is controlled via the `scaling` argument

- `scaling = 1` &amp;mdash; Focus on sites, scale site scores by `\(\lambda_i\)`
- `scaling = 2` &amp;mdash; Focus on species, scale species scores by `\(\lambda_i\)`
- `scaling = 3` &amp;mdash; Symmetric scaling, scale both scores by `\(\sqrt{\lambda_i}\)`
- `scaling = -1` &amp;mdash; As above, but for `rda()` get correlation scores
- `scaling = -2` &amp;mdash; for `cca()` multiply results by `\(\sqrt{(1/(1-\lambda_i))}\)`
- `scaling = -3` &amp;mdash; this is Hill's scaling
- `scaling &lt; 0` &amp;mdash; For `rda()` divide species scores by species' `\(\sigma\)`
- `scaling = 0` &amp;mdash; raw scores

---

# No one can remember all that&amp;hellip;

Use the text names instead:

* `scaling = "none"` means `scaling = 0`
* `scaling = "sites"` means `scaling = 1`
* `scaling = "species"` means `scaling = 3`
* `scaling = "symmetric"` means `scaling = 3`

For PCA (`rda()`) use `correlation = TRUE` to get the correlation scores (negative scaling)

For CA (`cca()`)  use `hill = TRUE` to get Hill's scaling scores (negative scaling)

# PCO

---

# Principal Coordinates Analysis

PCoA (or PCO, or **metric** multidimensional scaling (MDS)) finds a mapping to Euclidean space of `\(n\)` objects using the `\(n\)` by `\(n\)` matrix of dissimilarities `\(d_{ij}\)`

PCoA is an eigen decomposition like PCA

* first axis is the best 1D mapping of the dissimilarities
* subsequent axes are orthogonal to the first, but improve the mapping by smaller &amp; smaller amounts

Can use *any* dissimilarity coefficient (with a big **but**)

PCoA on a Euclidean distance matrix &amp;#8680; PCA (without species scores)

---

# Principal Coordinates Analysis

The big **but** is that not all dissimilarity coefficients can be represented in Euclidean space

If dissimilarity matrix is metric we're OK &amp;mdash; *usually*

If not metric, get negative eigenvalues &amp;#8680; correspond to distances in imaginary space

Distortion can be measured as

`$$\frac{\sum \left | \lambda^{-} \right |}{\sum \left | \lambda \right |}$$`

---

# PCoA &amp;mdash; correcting negative &amp;lambda;

1. Could square root transform the `\(d_{ij}\)`

2. Add a sufficiently large constant to `\(d_{ij}\)` or `\(d_{ij}^2\)`

    * **Lingoes** method: `\(\hat{d}_{ij} = \sqrt{d_{ij}^2 + 2c_1}\)` for `\(i \neq j\)`

        where `\(c_1\)` is `\(\mathsf{max} \left ( \left | \lambda_i^{-} \right | \right )\)`

    * **Cailliez** method: `\(\hat{d}_{ij} = d_{ij} + c_2\)` for `\(i \neq j\)`
	
	    where `\(c_2\)` is computed from a special matrix formed during the PCoA calculations

# NMDS

---

# Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling

NMDS find a low-dimensional mapping that preserves as best as possible the .text-highlight[rank order] of the original dissimilarities `\(d_{ij}\)`

Solution with minimal `stress` is sought; a measure of how well the NMDS mapping fits the `\(d_{ij}\)`

Stress is sum of squared residuals of monotonic regression between distances in NMDS space, `\(d^{*}_{ij}\)`, &amp; `\(d_{ij}\)`

Non-linear regression can cope with non-linear responses in species data

Iterative solution; *convergence is not guaranteed*

Must solve separately different dimensionality solutions

---

# Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling

- Use an appropriate dissimilarity metric that gives good gradient separation `rankindex()`, e.g Bray-Curtis, Jaccard, Kulczynski
- Wisconsin transformation useful; Standardize species to equal maxima, then sites to equal totals `wisconsin()`
- Use many random starts and look at the fits with lowest stress (`try` &amp; `trymax`
- Only conclude solution reached if lowest stress solutions are similar (Procrustes rotation)
- Fit NMDS for 1, 2, 3, &amp;hellip; dimensions; stop after a sudden drop in stress observed in a screeplot
- NMDS solutions can be rotated ; common to rotate to PCs
- Also scale axes in half-change units

???

Half-change units: samples separated by a distance of 1 correspond, on average, to a 50% turnover in composition

Shepard diagram which is a plot of ordination distances and monotone or linear fit line against original dissimilarities.  In addition, it displays two correlation-like statistics on the goodness of fit in the graph. The nonmetric fit is based on stress S and defined as R2 = 1-S*S. The “linear fit” is the squared correlation between fitted values and ordination distances. For monoMDS, the “linear fit” and R2 from “stress type 2” are equal.

# Supplementary data

If we have other data collected at the same sites, say about the environment, we can investigate relationships between the main components of variation in species composition and those environmental variables

Two main **vegan** functions for this

1. `envfit()` and helpers `vectorfit()` and `factorfit()`

2. `ordisurf()`

`envfit()` fits vectors or planes while `ordisurf()` fits smooth, potentially non-linear surfaces

---

# Vector fitting

`envfit()` fits vectors using a regression

`$$\hat{y_i} = \beta_1 x_{1i} + \beta_2 x_{2i} + \cdots \beta_p x_{pi}$$`

where:

* `\(x_{pi}\)` are the site scores for the `\(i\)`&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; site on axis 1, 2, &amp;hellip;, `\(p\)`
* Usually `\(p = 2\)` as we're fitting vectors into 2D ordination plots
* `\(y_i\)` is the value of the environment at the `\(i\)`&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; site
* `envfit()` can handle a matrix of environmental variables

*Note no intercept; internally center `\(\boldsymbol{y}\)` and `\(\boldsymbol{x_p}\)`*

For categorical `\(\boldsymbol{y}\)`, `envfit()` finds averages of scores for each level of the category

`ordisurf()` fits smooth surfaces using a GAM via package **mgcv**

where `\(f()\)` is a *bivariate* smooth function of a pair of axis scores `\(x_{1i}\)` and `\(x_{2i}\)`
